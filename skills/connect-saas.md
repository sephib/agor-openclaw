# Skill: connect-saas

**When to use:** The user asks to connect an external service, or a concrete task would materially benefit from direct access to one.

**Goal:** Find the best maintained connection path and apply it safely in Agor. This is a research method + Agor wrapper, not a hand-maintained SaaS catalog.

## Principles

- Lead with the value the connection unlocks.
- Recommend one high-leverage source based on the user's goal; do not present a catalog.
- Prefer reusable, approved paths over one-off secrets.
- Offer to configure the connection, while making clear where the user can
  review, change, or disable the same configuration in Agor.
- Ask/apply the user's security stance from `USER.md` when scopes, visibility, or posting are involved.
- Never ask for secrets in chat. Prefer OAuth; otherwise discover and use the
  secure credential widget appropriate to the connection.
- Verify: registered → enabled → attached to current session when needed → authenticated → tools visible → first useful action works.

## Research order

1. Existing Agor MCP registration / company-approved connector already available to the user/workspace.
2. MCP server + OAuth / URL discovery.
3. MCP server + Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).
4. Trusted community skill.
5. PAT/API token fallback with exact minimum scopes inline.

Registry pointers, not a catalog:

- Skills: [skills.sh](https://skills.sh), [SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com), [github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), internal `preset-io/agent-skills`, internal `preset-io/preset-agent-skills`.
- MCP: [registry.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io), [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), [Smithery](https://smithery.ai), [Glama](https://glama.ai), [mcp.so](https://mcp.so), [PulseMCP](https://pulsemcp.com), [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers).
- Meta-connectors: Zapier MCP, Composio, Pipedream.

## Agor wrapper

1. Discover exact Agor tool schemas at runtime (`mcp-servers`, service-specific tools, widgets).
2. Find or create the non-secret config. For remote OAuth, start simple: `name` + public `url` + `auth:{type:"oauth"}`; add client/endpoints only if discovery/DCR fails.
3. If session-scoped, attach it to the **current session**; don't stop at “registered.”
4. Check authentication status. If a credential is unavoidable, explain its
   type and minimum scope, invoke the appropriate secure flow, then stop while
   the user completes it.
5. Verify tools are visible after refresh/re-prompt if needed.
6. Do the first useful action from live context, usually read/summarize/draft before write/post; authentication alone is not an outcome.
7. If the result has recurring value, offer a specific cadence through Agor's scheduler and agree on scope, output, destination, and how to stop it.
8. Return the connection or settings link when available and explain how the
   user can review, narrow, or disable it.
9. Record outcome in memory/Knowledge if available; never record secrets.

## Examples

- **GitHub:** Prefer existing GitHub MCP/App/OAuth. PAT fallback should be fine-grained, selected repos only, minimum permissions for the task.
- **Fellow:** Try public MCP `https://fellow.app/mcp` with OAuth. Verify current-session attachment. Watch for redirect URI allowlisting on dev/test hosts.
- **Slack:** Prefer an existing company Slack app/MCP if available. Proactive posts require an outbound-capable Slack connector and explicit posting policy.
