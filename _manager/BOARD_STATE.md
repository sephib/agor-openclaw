## Key Changes Since Last Run (Jun 19 18:33 IDT)

| What observed | Status |
|---|---|
| **PR #1601 (jn-5675)** | ↔ UNCHANGED — MERGEABLE, CI still catastrophic (8 checks failing). Same CI run from 09:19 IDT. No new commits in ~10 hours. |
| **PR #1604 (jn-5676)** | ↔ UNCHANGED — CONFLICTING + DRAFT. pre-commit failing only (2 checks). Last updated: Jun 18 16:14 IDT. |
| **PR #1588 (jn-5546)** | ↔ UNCHANGED — pre-commit failing (2 checks). MERGEABLE. Last CI run: Jun 18 15:12 UTC. |
| **No new merges to main** | ℹ️ Last merge: PR #1599 (jn-5674) Jun 18 20:55 UTC (23:55 IDT) |
| **No new CI runs on board** | ℹ️ Zero pushes across all board branches — board fully static for 11+ hours. |
| **PR #1606 (JN-5725, off-board)** | 🔴 **STATUS CHANGE**: e2e-smoke COMPLETED as FAILURE at 18:39 IDT (after 2h11m run). e2e-tests also FAILED. All other 10 checks still PASSING. PR MERGEABLE + REVIEW_REQUIRED — blocked by e2e failures. Needs rerun (likely flaky infrastructure given 2h+ runtime). |

## Attention Items

### 🚨 HIGHEST PRIORITY — jn-5675 `__init__.py` still broken

PR #1601 is **MERGEABLE** (conflicts resolved by session 019ede80 at ~09:14 IDT). But ALL CI checks continue to fail:
- `pre-commit-run / pre-commit` FAILURE
- `tox-run / tox` FAILURE
- `integration-run / integration` FAILURE
- `e2e-api / e2e` FAILURE
- `pre-commit` FAILURE
- `nox` FAILURE
- `integration-tests` FAILURE
- `e2e-tests` FAILURE

Root cause: broken `__init__.py` conflict resolution from session 019ede80 ("merged both sides"). Fix session needed.

### 🔴 OFF-BOARD — PR #1606 (JN-5725) e2e-smoke FAILED (after 2h11m run)

PR #1606 status as of 18:39 IDT:
- 10 of 12 checks PASSING (pre-commit-run ✅, tox ✅, integration ✅, e2e-api ✅, pre-commit ✅, nox ✅, integration-tests ✅, atlas-validate ✅)
- **e2e-smoke / e2e: FAILURE** (ran 13:28→15:39 UTC = 16:28→18:39 IDT — 2h11m)
- **e2e-tests: FAILURE** (downstream, ran 15:39 UTC — 5s after e2e-smoke)
- MERGEABLE + REVIEW_REQUIRED

The hung job has now resolved as FAILURE. Given the 2h11m runtime this is almost certainly a flaky infrastructure timeout, not a real code failure. Joseph needs to **re-run the failed jobs** in GitHub Actions UI (or re-trigger CI). Once e2e-smoke passes, PR will only need a review approval.

---

### 🔴 jn-5676 — CONFLICTING but CI Almost Clean

**Good news:** CI for PR #1604 significantly improved. tox / integration / nox / integration-tests / e2e-tests are all PASSING. Only pre-commit is failing (2 checks). Once rebased and pre-commit fixed, this PR would be ready to un-draft and review.

---

### 🔴 PR #1588 (JN-5546) — pre-commit + sephib MUST FIX

Unchanged. BEHIND (not MERGEABLE) + pre-commit failing + sephib MUST FIX items outstanding.

---

### 🔴 FILESYSTEM FAILED — internal-cr-system

Git lock error — unchanged.

---

### ⚠️ ci-statistics-notebook — scope unclear

No sessions. JN-5708 is Done. Unchanged.
