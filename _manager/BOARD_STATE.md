| What observed | Status |
|---|---|
| **🔴 PR #1606 CI run 27952850789 COMPLETED — e2e-api STILL FAILING** | Run completed ~16:00 IDT Jun 22. Pre-commit ✅, integration ✅, tox ✅, nox ✅. BUT e2e-api ❌ FAIL, e2e-tests ❌ FAIL.

| **↔ PR #1615 triple problem** | Unchanged — DRAFT + CONFLICTING + pre-commit FAIL. |
| **↔ PR #1588 needs reviewer** | Unchanged — MERGEABLE, no reviewer, Jira still "In Progress". |

## Attention Items

### 🎉 PR #1604 (JN-5676) — ALL GREEN — ASSIGN REVIEWER NOW (URGENT)

PR [#1604](https://github.com/Jounce-IO/jounce/pull/1604) — "feat(jbenchmark): notebook scaffold + operational mode (JN-5676)"

**ALL CI CHECKS PASS.** MERGEABLE. reviewDecision="" — no reviewer yet. This has been flagged for **8 consecutive heartbeats (~4 hours)**.

**Required action:** Assign reviewer immediately.

---

### 🔴 PR #1606 (JN-5725) — e2e-api STILL FAILING (fix attempt failed)

PR [#1606](https://github.com/Jounce-IO/jounce/pull/1606) — "feat(vllm-analyzer): integrate log analyzer into experiment-workflow (JN-5725)"

CI run 27952850789 **COMPLETED** ~16:00 IDT Jun 22. Pre-commit ✅, integration ✅, tox ✅, nox ✅. **e2e-api ❌ FAIL, e2e-tests ❌ FAIL.** The fix push that triggered this run did NOT resolve the e2e-api regression introduced by PR #1602 merge.

JN-5725 is "Done" in Jira, but PR is blocked on CI failures. This is the 2nd consecutive CI run with e2e-api failing.

**Required action:** Investigate why e2e-api is failing in #1606 — the regression from #1602 needs deeper diagnosis. Consider whether JN-5725 needs another fix push or if the root cause is structural.

---
